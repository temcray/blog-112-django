# Important notes for Django Projects

# Additional Notes

- All of the subcommands for django are going to be called followed by python (or python3) manage.py (e.g. python manage.py runserver)
- If we want to check the full list, we can run python manage.py
- To create an app we need to run "python manage.py startapp NAME_OF_THE_APP" (remember to change NAME_OF_THE_APP for the actual name)
- After a creation of an app make sure to create the urls.py file inside of the app (IF AND ONLY IF you're going to create views on it)
